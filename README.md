# 🌸 Geometry of Global Trust

**Visualizing how we trust AI across cultures—one flower at a time.**

This interactive project explores global sentiment toward AI using symbolic flower visuals. Each flower represents a unique blend of five emotions:

- 🌞 **Hope**  
- 😨 **Fear**  
- 🤔 **Curiosity**  
- 😟 **Anxiety**  
- 💪 **Empowerment**

These are mapped from survey data based on **country** and **age group**. Users can also generate and "plant" their own trust flower in a shared digital garden—contributing to a growing, visual archive of public sentiment.

## 👩‍💻 Why I Built This

I just wrapped up my **freshman year at UC Berkeley**, and this project was inspired by my long-standing love for **Desmos art** and **data-driven storytelling**. I wanted to create something lightweight, meaningful, and visually compelling—something that transforms abstract trust data into art people can explore and even participate in.
